##Compatibility of Tapo Smart Home Devices with Apple HomeKit
Sadly, not all Tapo smart home devices are Apple HomeKit compatible. So, if you have a non-HomeKit compatible Tapo device, Tapo HomeKit integration is an obvious choice for those who want to control their Tapo devices with the Apple Home app and Siri.

##Control your Tapo devices with Apple HomeKit using the Homebridge solution.

- Install Homebridge.
- Install Tapo Homebridge Plugin. ([Download the Latest Release here]("https://github.com/kopiro/homebridge-tapo-camera/releases/tag/v2.3.4"))
- Update your Homebridge configuration file.
- This Homebridge Tapo Plugin is for the TP-Link Tapo P100, P105, P110 Plugs, and L510E Lightbulbs.

##How to Add HomeKit Compatible TP-Link Tapo Devices to Apple HomeKit
